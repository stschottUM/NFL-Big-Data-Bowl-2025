Update for Jan 25, 2025: I have been too busy with work and school to work on this project.
It can be viewed as an example of the data processing code I can write, but it is not finished or polished or ready for presentation.

This project uses the data sets from the NFL Big Data Bowl 2025 posted to Kaggle. 
I am doing an exploratory data analysis primarily focusing on pre-snap motion and what it does for an offense.
